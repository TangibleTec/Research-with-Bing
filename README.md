This app loads search categories from the files in WordLists.

**aSearchCatagories.txt** - Is the main categories file that generates the categories list in the app.

The data is in csv form, where the first part is the category name, followed by the word list source.

All other .txt files, are the current word list souces. These are simply newline separted lists, with the first line being the GITHUB url.

Please feel free to add more categories, and populate the word list for any category.
