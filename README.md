# Files and their uses
**aSearchCatagories.txt** - Is the main categories file that stores a list of all of the word lists.
The data is in csv form, where the first part is the category name, followed by the word list source.

All other .txt files, are the current word list souces. These are simply newline separted lists.

Please feel free to contribute more categories, and populate the word list for any category.
