# Research-with-Bing
[ReSearch with Bing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_Rstar111.BingSearch) was an experiment to try and devlope a simple app with [MIT AppInventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu).

The app simple takes a list of search words and phrases, grouped by catagories, and preformes Bing searches randomly from the selected list.

This app loads search categories from this GitHub project (files in WordLists).

**aSearchCatagories.txt** - Is the main categories file that generates the categories list in the app.

The data is in csv form, where the first part is the category name, followed by the word list source.

All other .txt files, are the current word list souces. These are simply newline separted lists, with the first line being the GITHUB url.

Please feel free to add more categories, and populate the word list for any category.
